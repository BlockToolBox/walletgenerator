# walletgenerator
Task 4 of the Blocktools Learn2Earn initiative. 

Attached are 2 simple codes for a multi chain Wallet Generator that works across EVMs (example BASE, ARB, ETH) 

**Things for you to do: **

> **To load **-> VS Code -> Live Server Extension -> Go Live -> Generate Wallet

> **To enhance:**

- Find ways to improve security using pop ups and adding hashing to give the user an even more secure experience
  
- Play with adding vanity address generator that runs on a loop and stops when an appealing address is found, for example 0xdead.... or 0x007... or 0xfeed etc

- Play with adding multiple wallet generation - For example 10 at a time, to give the user 10 wallets that he can quickly use for any purpose from sniping to securely transferring funds quickly using a route
